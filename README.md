# C Programming Exercises â€“ Polytech

## Overview
This repository contains various **C programming codes and exercises** developed during my studies at **Polytech**.  
The main goal of these projects was to **learn and practice the fundamentals of programming in C**, including:

- Variables, data types, and operators  
- Control structures (loops, conditionals, switch)  
- Functions and modular programming  
- Pointers and memory management  
- Arrays, strings, and basic data structures  
- File input/output

## Purpose
These codes are not meant to be production-ready but rather serve as a **learning archive** from my time in college.  
They reflect my progress while building programming logic and understanding the low-level aspects of computer science.

##  How to Compile & Run
To compile any of the `.c` files:  

```bash
gcc filename.c -o program
./program
